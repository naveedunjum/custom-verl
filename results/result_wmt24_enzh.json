Prior to joining the EPA, Uhlmann - the EPA assistant secretary for enforcement - had served as the longtime head of that division's Environmental Crimes Section, from 1990 through 2007. The EPA sends its most serious civil and criminal cases to ENRD, which - as a relatively underfunded office - often relies on other agencies in helping to choose which fights to take on. In fiscal year 2022, the EPA deferred fewer cases to DOJ (88) than at any point since 2000 and concluded fewer civil judicial cases than it had since that time, as well. As the Environmental Integrity Project notes, even Trump's EPA concluded 94 civil cases and deferred 106 cases per year to the DOJ per year, on average.\n",

A far simpler solution would be to let the market return to normal, not impose external controls on rent levels, and the result will be lower rent increases than we have seen in the last 18 months. To stabilise rental prices in the long term then the government must encourage greater investment and growth in the private rented sector (PRS) while simultaneously funding a substantial growth in the supply of social housing. The greater the investment in the PRS the more stability will be created in the housing market. Increasing volumes in both the PRS and social housing markets will stabilise rents over time as demand meets supply and equilibrium is achieved.

The original sentence is: \"Greggs plans to make more dough with major further branch expansion while holding prices.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key components. \"Greggs\" is the company name, so it should remain as is. \"plans to make more dough\" refers to increasing dough production. \"major further branch expansion\" means expanding their branch network. \"while holding prices\" indicates that prices will remain the same.\n\nNow, translating each part accurately. \"Plans to make more dough\" can be translated as \"计划增加面团产量\". \"Major further branch expansion\" is \"大规模扩张门店网络\". \"While holding prices\" becomes \"同时保持价格不变\".\n\nPutting it all together, the translation should be clear and maintain the original meaning. I need to ensure that the terms like \"branch expansion\" are correctly translated to \"门店网络扩张\" and that the conjunction \"while\" is appropriately translated to \"同时\".\n\nDouble-checking for any possible misunderstandings.

Scientists at the John Innes Centre may have found out. Land plants survive by getting water and nutrients from the soil. They do this by forming a special friendship with soil dwelling fungi called mycorrhiza. These strands of mycorrhiza reached deep into the soil and drag the nutrients and water back to the plants. But when the first algae landed on soil, how did they survive long enough to form these beneficial friendships?\n",
